## How to Use
To use our Content Tool, simply visit our web application and click on the "generate content" button to generate random content ideas. You can customize prompts by adding an industry or goal or even a specific platform and save your favorites for later use. The more specific you are the more detailed your content is, but as a generator, you can also start vague to get some more ideas about what you should be asking! That way, creating content for your business becomes easy and fun! 

Once content is created you can then edit or delete that content. You can also click on specific content to add notes or organize your content.
